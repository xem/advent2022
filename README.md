# Advent of Code Golf 🌊⛳️🏌️

This repository contains solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.  The goal is to write the shortest possible solution for each challenge. This is called "golfing" and is a common practice in programming competitions.

## Contribute 🔨

Everyone is welcome to contribute.  Please submit a pull request with your solution.  The solution should be placed in a folders named after the day and the subchallenge (e.g. `day1/a`). The files should be named after the number of bytes in the solution (e.g. `123b.html`).

The solution should be a single file and should not require any external dependencies. The solution should be written in JavaScript. There is a [template file](TEMPLATE.html) available to get you started.

Feel free to start working on challenges that are not yet solved. The challenges do not have to be solved in order. You can also try to improve existing solutions. Discussions or ideas are welcome in the issues.
